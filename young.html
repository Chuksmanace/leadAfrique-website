                <p>Many young adults are conflicted in areas of school, friends, parents, dating and sex, addictions and
                    self-worth especially as they transition to boarding schools and receive tertiary education. The

                    answer some of life’s most challenging questions as they prepare for the next stage of their lives.

                    is a 1-week self and purpose discovery summer camp for upper primary, junior high, senior high, and
                    university-bound young people between ages 6 -20. At the end of every academic year, hundreds of
                    emerging student leaders from across the country are camped to be groomed in the art of leadership
                    and statesmanship. By participating in the camp, students gain skills in self-awareness, personal
                    growth, confidence, and self-esteem in an environment that fosters learning character traits that
                    will propel them into their sometimes-uncertain yet prosperous future.</p>

                    LeadAfrique has so far planned and executed 1-week camps and a regional tour for over 300 young
                    people during the long vacation and proposes to bring its expertise to the schools via exchange
                    programs in other countries and cultural diversity learning across Ghana and other countries. We
                    have both local and international tours, camps, expeditions and school exchange programs that
                    prepare our young ones to be global citizens. The purpose of these experiential learning trips is to
                    empower and enable participants to be more independent minded, gain rich cultural diversity,
                    cultivate a better understanding of self-outside their familiar environment, resolve conflict, and
                    become a more dynamic individual.</p>

                        Every year Prefects are elected to lead various offices in a school without often times

                        they will lead, learn to be led and to serve and to leave a legacy.
